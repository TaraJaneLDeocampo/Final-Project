    <h4 class="ot">World Hunger is caused by many factors such as economic, political, environmental, and social causes. But it is mainly or mostly caused by poverty, especially since there are people who lack resources to buy or grow enough food. Lack of resources to be able to grow food leads to food shortages, which means that there would be nothing for farmers to grow and we would have nothing to consume. Climate change also plays a role in this, mostly because if the weather is extreme or is not the right weather for growing resources such as crops it would result in the decrease of agricultural output. While political instability and poor governance can increase or worsen problems about world hunger. Unstable economic system, includes the rise of food prices, which makes it harder for certain people to afford their basic necessities. When we experience such problems it can affect us in various ways such as developing health problems and our education. Which is why being aware of what causes World Hunger is crucial to avoid experiencing it as much as possible.</h4>
